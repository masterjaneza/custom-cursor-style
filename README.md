# 🎯 Custom Cursor Style | V1

A minimal, stylish custom cursor effect made with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
Ideal for interactive websites, portfolios, or any layout that demands a bit of flair.

Smooth animations. Fully customizable. No dependencies.

---

## 🚀 What It Does

- Replaces the default cursor with a custom animated dot + circle.
- Follows user movement in real-time with a trailing animation.
- Expands and reacts on hover and click events.
- Easy to implement and modify.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- **HTML** provides a simple structure with no extra markup.
- **CSS** handles styling, sizing, and animations of the cursor elements.
- **JavaScript** listens for mouse movement and interaction events:
  - `mousemove` updates cursor position.
  - `mousedown` and `mouseup` trigger scaling animations.
  - `mouseenter` / `mouseleave` control visibility and reset.
